	<h1> Welcome to the Squad. </h2>
	<p> Disrupt Harlem Code Squad is where Harlem youth come to code. Born through a partnership between the Knowledge House and the Harlem Business Alliance, the code squad blends these two areas to prepare students for the future. We learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and develop business ideas that will improve our communities and change the world.
